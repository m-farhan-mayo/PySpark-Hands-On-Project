# PySpark-Hands-On-Project


This workspace represents a comprehensive PySpark learning and development environment built using JetBrains PyCharm, designed to help you understand Spark concepts through real-time, hands-on coding examples. It contains multiple scripts and folders that collectively cover Spark setup, DataFrame operations, SQL integration, and PySpark transformations.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the files and folders:

FirstSpark_Project/ – The main project directory where the foundational setup for PySpark is implemented. It typically includes environment configuration, SparkSession creation, and your first PySpark application.

Spark Tutorial/ – A structured collection of tutorial files that walk through various Spark concepts step-by-step — from initializing a Spark session to performing data transformations and actions.

ExploringColumn.py – Demonstrates how to explore and manipulate DataFrame columns using functions like select(), withColumn(), and expressions to rename or derive new columns.

First Spark Development.py – Covers the initial setup and creation of Spark applications, illustrating how to load data, perform basic transformations, and understand the Spark execution flow.

Join_Expr.py – Focuses on join operations between DataFrames, including inner, outer, left, and right joins, with examples of how to optimize them for performance.

MiscDemo.py – A miscellaneous demonstration file containing various PySpark operations such as filtering, aggregations, and grouping to explore Spark’s core functionalities.

Python Code.py – Includes Python helper functions and utilities that support Spark workflows — ideal for modular, reusable code snippets.

Spark DataFrame _.py – Provides examples for creating and manipulating Spark DataFrames, exploring schema inference, column transformations, and basic data analysis tasks.

Spark_DataFrame.py – Builds upon the previous file with more advanced DataFrame operations such as groupBy(), agg(), and working with complex data types.

Spark_Table.sql – A SQL script used to demonstrate integration between Spark SQL and PySpark DataFrame APIs — allowing comparisons between SQL-based and Python-based queries.

SQL To Python.py – Illustrates how to translate SQL queries into equivalent PySpark code, helping learners understand how SQL logic maps to Spark transformations in Python.

Overall, this workspace serves as a complete PySpark practice hub, combining Python scripting, Spark SQL, and data engineering techniques. It’s perfect for mastering both foundational and intermediate PySpark concepts essential for real-world data engineering and big data projects.
